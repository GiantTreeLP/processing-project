Use the provided `pom.xml` file to compile and package this project using Maven.
It comes already setup so run `mvn package` and your `.jar` file is ready to go.

## Extending

Extending the code is as simple as it sounds.
Simply write your code like this is any other Processing sketch.
There is a `// TODO` comment for you where you can easily write your code.

## Contributing

It would be nice, if you matched the style of the original source.
If you can't, I will fix your formatting.
